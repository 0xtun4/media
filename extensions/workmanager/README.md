# ExoPlayer WorkManager extension

This extension provides a Scheduler implementation which uses [WorkManager][].

[WorkManager]: https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager.html

## Getting the module

The easiest way to get the module is to add it as a gradle dependency:

```gradle
implementation 'com.google.android.exoplayer:extension-workmanager:2.X.X'
```

where `2.X.X` is the version, which must match the version of the other media
modules being used.

Alternatively, you can clone the ExoPlayer repository and depend on the module
locally. Instructions for doing this can be found in ExoPlayer's
[top level README][].
